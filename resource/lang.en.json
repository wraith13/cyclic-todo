    "poem.todo.description": "It is said that continuity is power. Of course, if the amount you take each time is very small, you won't see any effects no matter how much you continue. However, the first step is to continue. If you keep doing it for a long time, there will be many days when you don't have time, are injured or sick, or even if you don't go that far, you feel somehow unwell or just don't feel like it. In such a case, consider it complete if you can do even 10% of what you originally planned. If you try too hard, it will be a curse that will make you feel lazy the next time you start working on a ToDo. The first thing you need to do is keep trying. Let's work hard on quality and quantity little by little after making it a habit so that you can continue without trying hard!",
